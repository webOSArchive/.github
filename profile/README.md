## webOS Archive ðŸ‘‹

Palm and HP's webOS mobile platform was a relatively short-lived entry in the mobile OS wars. Built-on Linux foundations, it leveraged web frameworks (NodeJS, and Mojo and Enyo front-end javascript libraries) to provide stunning UIs and a fluid multi-tasking environment. Palm later added a PDK for writing directly to the hardware. 

Because of the technology choices used, the platform was incredibly fun and customizable, and pioneered a number of UI innovations that modern smart phones still copy. After its sale to HP, and an even shorter lived forray into tablet form factors, the platform was sold off to LG where its descendents are still used in their TVs.

This is a fan-led effort to preserve and provide access to historical artifacts related to the platform, much of which was open source. There are no commercial aspirations, and all materials are subject to fair use provisions of US copyright law, as the project serves the public interest in preservation, access and research.
